The java project that test from tutorial
Hi there, I am a beginner at Java but I love to documented all my Project. Here I create a repository to make anybody see what I am doing whoever you are. I hope that a master out there can join to make a little assist for me to fix an error message in my code. For all of kindness, my god grade your good deed. Thanks
